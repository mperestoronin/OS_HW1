While there are a few steps to this lasagna recipe, it’s easy to make and has so much flavor. This dish can be made ahead of time and freezes well either before or after baking! Homemade lasagna may have a few steps, but each step is easy – and I assure you it’s worth the time; the perfect Italian meal! The best lasagna recipe is made with ingredients that you know, and it’s not difficult at all! or this classic lasagna recipe, the filling contains ricotta and parmesan with seasonings and a couple of tablespoons of parsley. No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe! I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add a 1/4 teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor.
